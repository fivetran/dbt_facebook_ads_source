# Facebook Ads (Source)

This package models Facebook Ads data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads). It uses data in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/facebook-ads#schemainformation).

## Models

This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [Facebook Ads modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_facebook_ads) and our [multi-platform Ad Reporting package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_ad_reporting). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
 * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
 * Timestamps are appended with `_timestamp`
 * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the campaign table's ID column is renamed `campaign_id`.

## Installation Instructions

## Configuration

### Required Report(s)

To use this package, you will need to configure your Facebook Ads connector to pull the `BASIC_AD` pre-built report. Follow the below steps in the Fivetran UI to do so:
1. Navigate to the connector setup form (**Setup** -> **Edit connection details** for pre-existing connectors)
2. Click **Add table** 
3. Select **Pre-built Report**
4. Set the table name to `basic_ad`
5. Select `BASIC_AD` as the corresponding pre-built report
6. Select a daily aggregation period
7. Click **Ok** and **Save & test**!

### Source Data Location
By default, this package will look for your Facebook Ads data in the `facebook_ads` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your Facebook Ads data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    facebook_ads_schema: your_schema_name
    facebook_ads_database: your_database_name 
```

### Changing the Build Schema
By default this package will build the Facebook Ads staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_facebook_ads`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your Facebook Ads staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    facebook_ads_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Spark.
